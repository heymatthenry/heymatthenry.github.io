Like literally everyone, I'm taking the occasion of the new year to rededicate myself to some habits I've let go fallow. With that in mind, in front of the all-seeing, all-knowing eye of The Internet, I hereby resolve to:

* **Write more** — I write a decent amount for school, and I will likely end up writing a fair bit more after graduation. But, I want to write more often and more regularly. Obviously intermittent blogging is a part of this.
* **Read more** — Again, obviously I read a ton for school, but I want to read more non-school-related things. I also want to be better at retaining what I read, and writing about it will help with that (About which, *supra*).
* **Code more** — I've done a little coding here and there since leaving my web dev career to go to law school, and it's been really fun.

These are broad goals, and I'll have to be honest with myself about how to make them [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria "SMART criteria - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")er, but for the sake of announcing them to the world, they're fine. As I refine them and come up with others, I'll share them here. It should be fun.
