I don't know about you, but I have a super hard time following through
on projects. Something that seems really cool or important at the time
I think of it almost immediately takes a back seat to the next shiny
thing that shows up in some blog post or article or paper or whatever.
That's not great. If something is worth doing, it's worth actually
doing.

A recent installment of Shawn Blanc's email newsletter, ["The Fight
Spot"](http://shawnblanc.net/newsletter/) clued me into the idea of
a "Now" page. This is a page you put up on your website that just lists
what projects currently have your focus and attention. Setting up a list
like this forces you to identify the things that have and that deserve
your attention. Revisiting the list and keeping it current will ensure
that I'm being intentional about how I spend my time, and not leaving
a trail of orphaned projects in my listless wake.

I considered handling this in OmniFocus somehow (something like
a "Now/Definitely" variant of the "Someday/Maybe" list), but I think
a big part of what makes the Now page a good idea is the fact that it's
public. So here it is, my [Now List](/now/).
