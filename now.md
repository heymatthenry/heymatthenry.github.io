These are the projects/endeavors that have my attention right now:

1. Figuring out how to be an effective, zealous advocate for the interests of my indigent clients.
2. Recommitting to some kind of GTD system built around Omnifocus. I've started using [Templates.scpt](http://cmsauve.com/projects/templates/) to create a new project for every new client (of which there are many!) to make sure I capture the things I have to do in every new case (of which there are many!).
3. Taking baby steps in learning Swift to: 1) scratch an itch, and stay at least a little nimble with my coding chops; and 2) solve an actual problem I have in my Pinboard/Instapaper workflows.
4. Reviewing scholarly work on plea negotiation. As much as I want to take things to trial, there's no getting around the fact that criminal defense practice almost entirely consists in negotiating pleas. I should figure out what I'm doing in that regard. This project was inspired by [this paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2651396), which also gave me a good bibliography to work through.

Thanks/apologies to [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/now/) for inspiring this page.
