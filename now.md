These are the projects/endeavors that have my attention right now:

1. Figuring out how to be an effective, zealous advocate for the interests of my indigent clients.
2. Building & maintaining a leaner, GTD-lite system for keeping track of what needs doing. While I've been a huge user of OmniFocus in the past, I (like a lot of people) am trying out 2Do for my to-dos. Right now, my system involves: 2Do, iCloud calendaring, and something like bullet journaling. It's been working well for me lately, and I've enjoyed all of the tinkering. I miss some things about OF, but overall, it's been a refreshing change.
3. Revisiting philosophy. I miss academia *so bad*, and I still think that I'm probably better at philosophy than anything I've ever done (though I do hope that someday I can say that about law). I've been reading a bunch of philosophy lately, and it's been invigorating. I hope to write more about it going forward.

Thanks/apologies to [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/now/) for inspiring this page.
